# `dragon_view` examples

## Usage

- Assuming the `vtk` and `pygan` libraries installation are completed (refer to root folder `README`)
  - `cd` to any of the directories
  - execute `python /path_to_cloned_repo/rDragView.py -c 'dragon_view' -n 'name_of_c2m_procedure'`

- Note that the `.c2m` procedure files also output the LCM object files. If rerunning the same test case, ensure beforehand that either the output in the `.c2m` file is commented/deleted _*or*_ delete the output LCM object files.
