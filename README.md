# DragView

`DragView` aims to help the visualisation of DRAGON/DONJON output using the ParaView software. While it is currently available only for the SN type calculation for 2D and 3D Cartesian or hexagonal geometries, it is hoped that this is flexible enough that other types of geometries and calculations can be added to this.
